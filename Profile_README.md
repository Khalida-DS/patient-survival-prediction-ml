## 🏥 Featured Project — Patient Survival Prediction

> End-to-end clinical ML pipeline predicting one-year patient survival with full explainability, drift monitoring, and a Streamlit decision support interface.

**What makes it production-grade:**
- ✅ Schema validation before any modeling
- ✅ Leak-free preprocessing inside cross-validation folds
- ✅ 5-model stratified CV benchmark (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, LR)
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
- ✅ Probability calibration (Platt scaling) — reliable clinical probabilities
- ✅ SHAP global + per-patient waterfall explanations
- ✅ Kaplan-Meier survival curves by patient subgroup
- ✅ MLflow experiment tracking and model registry
- ✅ Evidently data drift monitoring
- ✅ CI/CD via GitHub Actions (lint → unit tests → model smoke test)
- ✅ Dockerized deployment

**Tech:** Python · scikit-learn · XGBoost · LightGBM · SHAP · lifelines · MLflow · Evidently · Streamlit · Docker

## 🧠 Background

My path is a bit unusual — I spent years solving complex numerical problems in quantum few-body scattering theory (published in [*Physical Review C*](https://journals.aps.org/prc/) with collaborators at Ohio University and Ruhr-Universität Bochum). That kind of work — formulating hard problems mathematically, validating models rigorously, communicating results clearly — turns out to be exactly what serious data science requires.

I completed a Master's in Data Science to formalize this transition, specializing in healthcare ML because it's the domain where rigorous, calibrated, explainable modeling has the most direct human impact.
